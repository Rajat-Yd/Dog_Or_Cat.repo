# Dog_Or_Cat.repo
- This is a CNN build on Kaggle Dataset for classification between Dog and Cat images.
# What is CNN ? :
- A convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet) is a network architecture for deep learning that learns directly from data.
- CNNs are particularly useful for finding patterns in images to recognize objects, classes, and categories.
- They can also be quite effective for classifying audio, time-series, and signal data.
